    "## TopicFutures by Alan Hamm and Bertha\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided script is a comprehensive Python program that utilizes several libraries to perform \\\n",
    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling on text data. The script includes functionality for \\\n",
    "data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization, as well as handling distributed computing with Dask.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the script, various libraries are imported including pyLDAvis.gensim for interactive topic model \\\n",
    "visualization, torch for deep learning operations and GPU acceleration, gensim for LDA modeling and coherence \\\n",
    "computation, and dask.distributed for parallel and distributed computing.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "The script sets up directory paths for logging, models, and visuals based on a given decade (DECADE). It checks if these \\\n",
    "directories exist and contain data; if they do, it archives their contents into a ZIP file before removing the old \\\n",
    "subdirectories. New directories are then created for the current run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging configuration is established to record messages in a log file. Bokeh deprecation warnings are suppressed to avoid \\\n",
    "cluttering the output with irrelevant messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters such as alpha (document-topic density) and beta (word-topic density) are defined as lists of possible values \\\n",
    "that will be used during LDA model training. These parameters influence the sparsity or density of topics in documents \\\n",
    "or words associated with topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function named futures_create_lda_datasets() is defined to load data from a JSON file, shuffle it, split it into training \\\n",
    "and evaluation datasets based on a specified ratio (train_ratio), and return them as delayed objects ready for parallel processing with Dask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another function called save_model_and_log() takes care of saving trained LDA models along with their metadata into \\\n",
    "specified directories. It also logs this information into CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core function train_model() performs the actual training of LDA models using Gensim's LdaModel. It processes text documents \\\n",
    "in batches to create dictionary mappings and trains an LDA model per batch. Model performance metrics like convergence score, \\\n",
    "perplexity score, and coherence score are calculated during this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main execution block initializes a Dask cluster with specified worker configurations such as number of cores (CORES) and \\\n",
    "memory limits (RAM_MEMORY_LIMIT). A Dask client is created to manage tasks across workers. Training and evaluation datasets \\\n",
    "are prepared by calling the aforementioned functions. These datasets are scattered across workers for efficient parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A series of nested loops iterate over combinations of topic numbers (n_topics), alpha values (alpha_values), \\\n",
    "and beta values (beta_values) to submit training tasks for both the training and evaluation datasets. These tasks are \\\n",
    "submitted to the Dask client, which distributes them across the available workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script employs a progress bar from tqdm to visualize the progress of model creation and saving. It uses a batch processing \\\n",
    "approach where it waits for a certain number of futures (asynchronous task results) to complete before processing their \\\n",
    "results. If some futures do not complete within a specified timeout (TIMEOUT), they are recorded as failed and an attempt is \\\n",
    "made to retry them with an extended timeout (EXTENDED_TIMEOUT).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all models have been trained or reattempted, any remaining incomplete models' parameters are logged for review, indicating \\\n",
    "that these models did not successfully complete even after a second attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the script, various utility functions such as os, json, random, csv, and others are used for file operations, \\\n",
    "data manipulation, random shuffling of data, and logging results in CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this script assumes certain global variables like DECADE, DATA_SOURCE, TRAIN_RATIO, CORES,\\\n",
    "THREADS_PER_CORE, etc., are defined elsewhere in the code or environment since they are referenced but not explicitly \\\n",
    "defined within the provided code snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this script is designed for robust LDA topic modeling with extensive parameter exploration while leveraging distributed \\\n",
    "computing resources efficiently. It includes error handling mechanisms such as retries for failed tasks and comprehensive\\\n",
    "logging which aids in debugging and optimizing model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script is structured to handle large-scale topic modeling tasks in a distributed computing environment. After setting up\\\n",
    " the Dask client and workers, it proceeds to create training and evaluation datasets from a specified data source (DATA_SOURCE) \\\n",
    " using the futures_create_lda_datasets function. The resulting datasets are then scattered across the Dask cluster's workers \\\n",
    " for parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For model training, the script defines a train_model function that takes several parameters including the number of topics, \\\n",
    "alpha and beta values, and the dataset. This function processes text documents in batches, updating a global dictionary with \\\n",
    "each batch and training an LDA model using Gensim's LdaModel. It computes various performance metrics for each batch such as \\\n",
    "convergence score, perplexity score, and coherence score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main execution loop iterates over different combinations of model hyperparameters (number of topics, alpha values, beta values) \\\n",
    "and submits two sets of futures to the Dask client: one for training models on the training data (train_futures) and another \\\n",
    "for evaluating models on the evaluation data (eval_futures). These futures are monitored for completion, with progress tracked by a tqdm progress bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any futures do not complete within the given timeout period (TIMEOUT), they are added to a list of failed model parameters \\\n",
    "(failed_model_params) for later analysis. The script includes functionality to retry processing these incomplete futures with \\\n",
    "an extended timeout (EXTENDED_TIMEOUT). Once all models have been processed or reattempted, any remaining incomplete models' \\\n",
    "parameters are logged using both standard output and a performance logger (perf_logger).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, upon completion or failure of all tasks, the script closes the Dask client and provides an overview of which model parameters \\\n",
    "did not complete successfully after retries. This information can be used to diagnose potential issues in model training or resource \\\n",
    "allocation within the distributed computing setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this script is designed as an end-to-end solution for performing LDA topic modeling at scale. It incorporates best \\\n",
    "practices such as error handling through retries, logging important events and metrics for post-analysis, utilizing distributed\\\n",
    " computing resources effectively via Dask, and providing user feedback through progress bars. Users looking to employ this script \\\n",
    " should ensure they have set up their environment correctly with all necessary variables defined and have access to sufficient \\\n",
    " computational resources managed by Dask."

    "## Technical Documentation for LDA Model Data Management System\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The LDA Model Data Management System is designed to efficiently store and manage large volumes of text data and associated \\\n",
    "metadata generated by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models. The system allows for quick access to text data based on \\\n",
    "queries of the metadata, facilitating dynamic generation of pyLDAvis objects or other topic analysis visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### System Structure\n",
    "The system comprises a top-level directory with several subdirectories designated for logs, visuals, metadata, and compressed \\\n",
    "text data. Each large body of text is stored as an individual ZIP file to save space, while metadata is stored in a Parquet \\\n",
    "file for efficient querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Directory Structure**\n",
    "* ROOT_DIR: The base directory containing all data related to the LDA models. \\\n",
    "* LOG_DIR: A subdirectory within ROOT_DIR that stores log files.\\\n",
    "* IMAGE_DIR: A subdirectory within ROOT_DIR that stores visualization files such as images or charts.\\\n",
    "* METADATA_DIR: A subdirectory within ROOT_DIR that stores metadata in a Parquet file.\\\n",
    "* TEXTS_ZIP_DIR: A subdirectory within ROOT_DIR where each text file is saved as an individual ZIP archive.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "**File Formats**\n",
    "* **Parquet**: Used for storing metadata due to its efficiency in storage size and speed when querying columns.\n",
    "* **ZIP**: Used for compressing individual text files to minimize disk space usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "**save_text_to_zip**(text_data) \\\n",
    "Saves a given string of text data into a ZIP file within the TEXTS_ZIP_DIR.\n",
    "**Parameters**:\n",
    "* text_data (str): The string content representing the body of text to be saved.\n",
    "**Returns**:\n",
    "* (str): The path to the created ZIP file containing the text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**add_model_data_to_metadata**(model_data) \\\n",
    "Adds new model data entries to the existing metadata Parquet file. If no Parquet file exists, it creates one.\n",
    "**Parameters**:\n",
    "* model_data (dict): A dictionary containing model-related information including texts and various scores like convergence, perplexity, coherence, etc.\n",
    "**Side Effects**:\n",
    "* Updates or creates a Parquet file at METADATA_DIR/metadata.parquet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**get_text_from_zip**(zip_path)\n",
    "Reads and returns the content of a specified text from its corresponding ZIP archive.\n",
    "**Parameters**:\n",
    "* zip_path (str): The path to the ZIP archive containing the text data.\n",
    "**Returns**:\n",
    "* (str): The text content extracted from the ZIP file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**load_texts_for_analysis**(metadata_path, coherence_threshold=0.7) \n",
    "Loads metadata from a Parquet file and retrieves texts that meet specified criteria, such as a minimum coherence score.\\\n",
    "**Parameters**:\n",
    "* metadata_path (str): The path to the metadata Parquet file.\n",
    "* coherence_threshold (float, optional): The threshold for filtering records based on their coherence score. Defaults to 0.7.\n",
    "**Returns**:\n",
    "* (list of str): A list of text contents that meet the specified criteria.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "To use this system, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure that all necessary directories (LOG_DIR, IMAGE_DIR, METADATA_DIR, TEXTS_ZIP_DIR) are created within the top-level directory (ROOT_DIR).\n",
    "2. When new model data is generated, create a dictionary with keys corresponding to metadata fields and a 'text' key containing a list of large bodies of text.\n",
    "3. Call add_model_data_to_metadata(new_model_data) to save the text data into individual ZIP files and update or create the metadata Parquet file with references to these ZIP files.\n",
    "4. To retrieve texts for analysis based on metadata queries, call load_texts_for_analysis(parquet_file_path). You can specify a different coherence threshold if needed.\n",
    "5. For any specific text retrieval based on its ZIP archive path, use get_text_from_zip(zip_path)\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maintenance\n",
    "The system requires minimal maintenance:\n",
    "* Periodically check the available disk space in case the volume of stored texts grows significantly.\n",
    "* Backup important data regularly, especially the Parquet file containing metadata and references to text files.\n",
    "* Update directory paths and"

    "The method futures_create_lda_datasets is designed to read a JSON file containing a list of lists of tokens and yield batches \\\n",

    "## Asynchronous Execution as said by Brunhilda:\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous execution allows you to execute tasks concurrently, without waiting for each task to complete before moving on \\\n",
    "to the next one. This can improve the overall efficiency and speed of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given code snippet, asynchronous execution is achieved using Dask's as_completed function. This function takes a list \\\n",
    "of futures (representing tasks) and returns an iterator that yields futures as they complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) First, you submit all your training and evaluation tasks using client.submit(). These tasks are represented by futures. \\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) You add callback functions (callback_train and callback_eval) to these futures using the add_done_callback() method. These callbacks will be executed when their respective futures complete.\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) You create two lists, train_futures and eval_futures, to store the futures for training and evaluation models respectively.\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) After submitting all the tasks, you enter a loop where you iterate over the range of values for n_topics, alpha_value, and beta_value.\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Inside this loop, you submit the training and evaluation tasks for each combination of parameters using client.submit(). These new futures are added to their respective lists.\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Next, you use the as_completed function to iterate over both lists of futures (train_futures and eval_futures). This function returns an iterator that yields completed futures as they become available.\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) As each future completes, its associated callback function (callback_train or callback_eval) is executed.\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Inside these callback functions, you retrieve the result of the completed future using .result(). You can then save the trained or evaluated model using the provided save_model_and_log function.\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The loop continues until all combinations of parameters have been processed.\\\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Finally, after all models have been saved and logged, you close the Dask client. \n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing asynchronous execution with Dask's as_completed, your program can process multiple tasks concurrently while still ensuring that each model is saved once its associated task has completed."

    "The provided code snippet is part of a larger program that appears to be running machine learning model training and evaluation tasks in parallel using Dask, a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing. The code manages the execution of these tasks, handling retries for incomplete tasks, and tracking failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script begins by initializing an empty list called failed_model_params to store the parameters of models that fail to complete even after a retry. It also creates a dictionary named future_to_params to map \"futures\" (a representation of an asynchronous execution) to their corresponding model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two functions are defined: process_completed_futures, which processes completed futures, and retry_processing, which attempts to reprocess incomplete futures with an extended timeout period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main part of the script sets up multiple training and evaluation tasks across different combinations of hyperparameters (n_topics, alpha_value, and beta_value). These tasks are submitted to a Dask client asynchronously using the client.submit method. Each task returns a future, which is then mapped to its parameters in the future_to_params dictionary for later reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script uses batch processing controlled by a variable called BATCH_SIZE. Once enough futures have been accumulated, or when all loops have finished running, it waits for all futures within each batch to complete using Dask's wait function with a specified timeout (TIMEOUT). Completed futures are processed while those that remain incomplete are recorded in the failed_model_params list for further action.\n",
    "\n",
    "After processing each batch, if there are any remaining futures (either from incomplete batches or from the final iteration), they are retried using the previously defined retry_processing function with the same timeout value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are still models that failed after this first attempt, they get one more chance. The script prints out a message indicating it will retry these incomplete models with an extended timeout (EXTENDED_TIMEOUT). It resubmits these tasks and waits again for completion. Any models that remain incomplete after this second attempt are added back into the failed_model_params.\n",
    "\n",
